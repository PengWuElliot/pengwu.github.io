        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>Peng</strong>. I'm doing my master study in the double degree program between <strong>KTH </strong>and <strong>Aalto University</strong>.
            Currently I'm writing my thesis (Anomaly detection empowered by the diffusion model) under the guidance of <strong>Prof. Chao Yang</strong> and <strong>Professor Lei Feng</strong>.
            My study focuses on the implementation and application of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms. 
            I love being in nature and enjoy sitting and hiking in forests and mountains. I have a deep passion for reading, 
            from ancient Stoic philosophy to Hayek's political economy theories. They changed me a lot. 
        </p>
