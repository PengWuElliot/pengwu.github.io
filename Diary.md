I love my life here. I'll be more self-constraint and do meaningful things every day. I try to be a good person like the people I know.

Running

I watched too many videos today. I shouldn't do that. \
So run, horse, run down the road to the plain, run before it is too late. Don't stop even if you are tired before you see the green 
meadrows, the familiar trees, people's houses, the churches and the belfries.
